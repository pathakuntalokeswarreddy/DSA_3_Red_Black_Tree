/*
Deletion Properties:
step 1 : perform BST Deletion
step 2 : 
	case 1: If node to be deleted is RED, just delete it
	case 2: If root is DOUBLE BLACk(DB), just replace DB with BLACK
	case 3: If DB's sibling is BLACK and both its child are also black
		=> Then remove DB
		=> Add BLACK to the parent of DB node
			=> If parent is RED, it will become BLACK
			=> If parent is BLACK, it will become DOUBLE BLACK(DB)
		=> Recolor sibling of original DB with RED
		=> If DB still exist, choose relevent case and proceed
		[ If we are deleting Leaf node which is in BLACK, then it will become DB NIL node]
	case 4: If DB's sibling is RED
		=> swap colors of DB's (parent and sibling) nodes
		=> rotate parent of DB, in DB's direction
		=> recheck suitable case
	case 5: DB's sibling is BLACK and sibling's child who is far from DB is BLACK, but near child is RED
		=> swap colors of DB's sibling & sibling's child who is near to DB
		=> rotate sibling in opposite direction to DB
		=> Recheck cases
	case 6: DB's sibling is BLACK and far child is RED
		=> swap color of parent & sibling of DB
		=> rotate DB's parent in DB's direction
		=> remove DB
		=> change color of RED child to BLACK
